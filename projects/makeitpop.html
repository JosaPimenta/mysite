          The primary goal of this product was to create a mobile view,
          presenting 6-8 products in an aesthetically pleasing 2x2 grid layout.
          <br />
          The mobile view would feature product images, accompanied by their
          respective titles, categories, options (such as colors and sizes), and
          the corresponding prices.
          <br />
          Additionally, an essential aspect of the design was to incorporate a
          detailed product page that offers a closer look at one of the featured
          items. This detail page would showcase a larger image of the chosen
          product, along with a comprehensive description and additional product
          specifications.
          <br />
          Given that this project was undertaken as a part of my studies, I had
          the creative freedom to select a product that truly sparked my
          interest.
